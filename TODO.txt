Problems with web.py
- web.ctx.home -- how do I deploy in a subdirectory?
    webpyauth.py: RequestAdaptor.__init__: use REALHOME in full_url? Or somewhere else? Might get Google to come back to subdirectory
- web.session -- how do I access it in a request? (http://webpy.org/cookbook/session_with_reloader)


- mobile openid provider!!! oh that'd be so cool! You can charge for it. Just do it!
